        <p>This 5,000-year-old Greek capital is home to the iconic Acropolis with its hilltop of millennia-old structures and ruins, and just below it, the Plaka neighborhood, a labyrinth of streets lined with bars, restaurants, and ancient ruins.

        While Athens has never spoken to me the way that other European capitals have (I’m more a fan of the islands and the interior of the country), it has grown on me on each visit. You can’t deny the layers of history here. You’ll stumble across millennia-old ruins as you stroll down random streets (this is why I love taking walking tours in the city as I’ll learn a ton about what I’m actually looking at).</p>
